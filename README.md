# Trip-Me

Trip-me is a web application designed to help users manage their travel experiences. It is built on a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) model, which means that users can perform the four basic types of database operations on their trips.

With Trip-Me, users can add new trips to their profile by entering details such as the trip title, description, location, start date, and end date. They can also edit and update existing trips, allowing them to make changes to any of the details they have previously entered. In addition, users can delete any trip they no longer wish to keep track of.

All of a user's saved trips are displayed in a list, making it easy to view and manage multiple trips at once. The list includes details such as the trip title, description, location, start date, and end date, allowing users to quickly identify and select the trip they are looking for.
